    docker-compose -f docker-compose-dev_env.yml pull 
    docker-compose -f docker-compose-dev_env.yml up -d              //for dev environment

    docker-compose -f docker-compose-services.yml pull
    docker-compose -f docker-compose-services.yml up -d             //for all services (Requires previous compose first)

    docker-compose -f docker-compose-ras.yml pull 
    docker-compose -f docker-compose-ras.yml up -d	            //for RAS party and collection-instrument services (Without test data)

    ./ras-compose.sh					            //creates party & collection-instrument containers and populates database with test data

    docker-compose -f docker-compose-services.yml up -d [SERVICE]   //for only specific containers rather than all of them

# Changing variables

You can change the host and port values of services in the .env file

    Host must be either a container name, your IP or the service cloudfoundry path
    
# Ground Zero -- Requires groundzero.sh file from github

    ./groundzero.sh [SERVICE] [SERVICE] ...

Where service can be any number of:

    - case
    - action
    - actionexp
    - iac
    - sample
    - collex

or blank to delete and remake the whole database.

Alternativley you can run the groundzero.sql scripts in pgAdmin.

# To start all stopped containers

    docker start $(docker ps -a -q)

# To stop all containers
